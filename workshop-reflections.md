# Workshop Reflections

**Why did we create a workshop based on a Puzzle?**

First of all, we wanted to create a workshop that shows the following possibilities:

* Demonstrate Fuse Integration Services
* Demonstrate Development Approach with FIS
* Create discussion around REST vs JMS
  * This workshop is intentionally not touching REST due to the use-case
  * HTTP vs JMS - There is no wrong!
* MicroService approach with multiple POD's
* How to take a complex \(recursive\) algorithm and convert it to MSA
* Discuss Scale-out
* Beat a single machine using the cloud

So the creation of this workshop will brush on all the previous topics and it beats the normal presentations where a URL will return a page or where Camel Routes are just existing of a CBR/File demo.
