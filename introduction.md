## Help on the Internet

When looking at the initial challenge, I found a nice web-page created by [Jan Sipke van der Veen](https://jansipke.nl/yasumi-puzzle/) that provided a lot of feedback on the Puzzle and its challenges. He also provided me with the C code that solved the puzzle \(back in the days of the good old PentiumIII computers\) and I took it upon me to try and rebuild the solution in Java \(as my C knowledge was at a bare minimum\).

## The Puzzle

The Yasumi Puzzle \(or pentomino\) is a game in which different kinds of blocks have to be placed on a grid. Each block is made up of 5 cells each and there are 12 blocks in total. This is exactly the number of unique blocks that can be made up of 5 cells. In the original game these blocks have to be placed on a grid of 6 by 10. Blocks may be rotated if necessary.

The picture below shows you all the possible blocks of the puzzle:
