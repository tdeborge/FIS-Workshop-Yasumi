The Yasumi Puzzle \(or pentomino\) is a game in which different kinds of blocks have to be placed on a grid. Each block is made up of 5 cells each and there are 12 blocks in total. This is exactly the number of unique blocks that can be made up of 5 cells. In the original game these blocks have to be placed on a grid of 6 by 10. Blocks may be rotated if necessary.
