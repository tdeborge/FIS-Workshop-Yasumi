# LAB - 2

To start this lab, you can set the git to the start state by going to the project directory and executing:

**git checkout LAB2**

This should set the current content of the directory to include the following directories:

* GUIMonolithic
* GUIScaleOut
* SupportMaterials

# Hands-On:

As this is the first project we are using the Developer Studio, we will have to import the base project.

## Start Developer Studio

In the File menu, select the import option and import existing maven projects![](/assets/importmavenprojects.png)

Go to the directory where you have checked out LAB2:

![](/assets/checkoutDir.png)

And import the project.





Create a new Project based on the Maven Project Wizard:![](/assets/mvnCreateProject.png)

in the next screen, uncheck the default location and select the directory where you have cloned the workshop repository![](/assets/projectlocation.png)

insert '**fis**' into the filter and look for the correct archetype:![](/assets/Archetype.png)
