# Setting up the Lab Environment

\[\[PLACEHOLDER FOR OCP DEFINED ENVIRONMENT\]\]

In this section we need to make sure that all machines are setup and configured to talk to the OCP instance of choice.

TO BE FINALIZED



## Labs and Solutions

From the **git URL, **clone the environment to your local drive.

```
#Go to your home directory
cd
git clone https://github.com/tdeborge/FIS-Workshop-Yasumi.git FISLAB
cd FISLAB
```

When inspecting the FISLAB directory structure, you will find a Labs directory that will contain all sections \(labs\) we can touch upon. Each Lab sub-directory contains an exercise part that you will be able to complete and execute and a Solutions part that you can use to skip the step-through in the exercise part.
