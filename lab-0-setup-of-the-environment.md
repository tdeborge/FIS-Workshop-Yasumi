# Setting up the Lab Environment

\[\[PLACEHOLDER FOR OCP DEFINED ENVIRONMENT\]\]

In this section we need to make sure that all machines are setup and configured to talk to the OCP instance of choice.

TO BE FINALIZED

## Labs and Solutions

From the **git URL, **clone the environment to your local drive.

```
#Go to your home directory
cd
git clone https://github.com/tdeborge/FIS-Workshop-Yasumi.git FISLAB
cd FISLAB
```

When inspecting the FISLAB directory structure, you will find a Labs directory that will contain all sections \(labs\) we can touch upon. Each Lab sub-directory contains an exercise part that you will be able to complete and execute and a Solutions part that you can use to skip the step-through in the exercise part.

## Environment Configuration

In order to get some scripts working, it is important to make adjustments to the following file:

FISLAB/Labs/setenv.sh

```
#!/bin/sh
#PLEASE VALIDATE THE IP
export OCP_IP=
export USERNAME=
export PASSWORD=
```

### Workshop At Red Hat:

These variables will then be used in the scripts to get to your specific environment which is provided in the class.
