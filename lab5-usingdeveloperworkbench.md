# Using the Developer Workbench

In this Lab, we will be starting the Developer Workbench and import an existing Project. Then we will make some adjustments, deploy it using the mvn fabric8 plugin and view the deployment in the workbench using the OpenShift View Plugin.

## Starting the Workbench

Locate the JBoss Developer WorkBench and start it up.
