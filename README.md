# FIS Yasumi Workshop Introduction

This workshop document will walk you through a set of steps that I went through in order to get the FIS \(Fuse Integration Services\) Yasumi Application deployed on the OpenShift platform. It will be structured in such a way that through **git** commands, it is possible to skip or check certain steps and still being able to run it to completion.

## Preparation

### Machine setup:

Your machine will need to have the following items installed and in the PATH:

* JDK 1.8
* Maven 3.3
* Correctly configured settings.xml for maven that points to a Maven Repository that includes all the Red Hat locations
* Outside Red Hat prepared labs, a CDK \(container Development Kit\) for OpenShift
