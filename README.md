# FIS Yasumi Workshop Introduction

This workshop document will walk you through a set of steps that I went through in order to get the FIS \(Fuse Integration Services\) Yasumi Application deployed on the OpenShift platform. It will be structured in such a way that through **git** commands, it is possible to skip or check certain steps and still being able to run it to completion.
